Click to Call
=============

About
-----

This is a command line windows application that takes as parameters the target
phone and the internal phoneline and originates a phone call between the two.

If you do not provide an internal phone line as argument it will promt you
and store the given number in the windows registry so that it does not ask again.


Possibilities
-------------

Since this is a command line tool it can be easily integrated to any 3rd party
software to originate calls directly from there.

At the time of development I intended to integrate this to an ERP software but
you can use it however you like.
